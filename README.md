# 🏦 RFM-Based Customer Segmentation for Retail Banking

An interactive Streamlit dashboard and machine learning pipeline to segment retail banking customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and KMeans clustering. This tool empowers BankTrust to personalize services, reduce churn, and enhance marketing efficiency.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In today’s competitive financial landscape, customer expectations are higher than ever. This project brings a data-driven solution to BankTrust's key challenges—**customer churn**, **inefficient marketing**, and **lack of personalization**—by leveraging customer transaction data.

Using **RFM analysis** and **unsupervised learning (KMeans clustering)**, the project categorizes customers into behavioral segments and presents them via a user-friendly **Streamlit dashboard**.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- 🧠 Understand customer behavior using RFM metrics
- 🎯 Target marketing efforts toward high-value and at-risk segments
- 🤝 Improve customer retention through tailored engagement
- 📈 Enable non-technical teams to explore insights visually

## 🧪 Project Pipeline

### 1. RFM Feature Engineering
- **Recency** – Days since the customer's most recent transaction
- **Frequency** – Number of transactions over the observed period
- **Monetary** – Total transaction value over the observed period

### 2. Unsupervised Clustering (KMeans)
- Trained on normalized RFM features
- Optimal number of clusters chosen via the elbow method
- Segments assigned human-readable names for business usability:
  - `Active High Value`
  - `Loyal Frequent Buyers`
  - `Big Spenders - At Risk`
  - `Low Value / One-time`

### 3. Streamlit Dashboard
- Visualizes RFM distributions
- Filters customers by RFM metrics and segment
- Displays per-customer profiles
- Supports toggling between raw and clustered datasets
